# lix-calc

A [LIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIX) calculator as an excuse to write Hy.

Usage:

- `git clone https://github.com/skovsgaard/lix-calc`
- `cd lix-calc`
- `hy lix.hy "Replace me with text of your choosing."`

Note that if you actually need to run this on the contents of a file, there's no flag for that yet, so you'd have to run `hy lix.hy $(cat $FILENAME)`.
